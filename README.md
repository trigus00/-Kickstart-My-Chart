Homework 1 


•	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
-	Based on the data it seems that around 53.8 % of the kickstarter projects are more likely to be successful than to fail (37.6%). What’s interesting is that if we look into the outcomes of completed projects as separate categories, we see a stark difference (if we filter by successful and unsuccessful outcomes only). The data shows Kickstarters in music (82%), theatre (63%), film and video (63%), have the highest success rates and food (20%), games (36%) and publishing (50%) have the lowest success rates.


-	Looking at the sub category, I believe in my opinion that the sampling size is a little small for this data. Within the subcategory we have projects that are either 100% success rate (in blue) and 100% failed rate (in orange). This may be cause due to the sampling size. 


-	One thing that I noticed is there is a sudden drop of successful projects starting in June. While the trend of successful rate is falling, it seems to be narrowing down (going in pair) with the failed trend line up to the month of December. 
•	What are some limitations of this dataset?

The dataset provided is not large enough for all categories and subcategories, so some of the results are not statistically relevant given the small sample size. We need to figure out how statistically significant these results are. Also how the companies are drawing in the people ( crowdsourcing I think) of the company’s products.

•	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

It would be interesting to analyze the projects by the duration of conversion using the date created conversion and date ended conversion. Maybe there is a trend to see what separates the duration of successful and unsuccessful projects. If we could analyze the data by states, we could see trends in which states have Kickstarters with the highest rates of success and which ones have the lowest rate of success.
